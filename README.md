# Secondary Dominath 7th Chord Probable Extension Calculator 

This library gives you a "best guess" for chords and chord charts
as to what notes to play to sound in key. That being said, you are
always a half step away from a right note. This is by no means the 
"right" way to play jazz. However, it is a good starting point
for hearing common extensions in jazz.
